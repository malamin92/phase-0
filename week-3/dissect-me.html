			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
			learn how to dissect an HTML page from the head to the footer, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook the HTML docs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML docs</a> and begin!</p>

			<h2>Release 0: Setup</h2>
			<p>Decide who will drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
				<li>Using the command line, navigate to the <span>week-3</span> directory</li>
				<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called <span>dissect-me.html.</span></li>
				<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
				<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="https://github.com/%5BUSERNAME%5D/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)
		</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles halfway through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple Google doc).</p>

<!-- 
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	Some HTML elements that I used in this challange include, h1, p, spand, and an a element. These are some that I run across pretty often.
	The head and body tags are also on every page that I've written. I also frequently see the ul or ol tags along with li for lists. Those are
	some I return to often, also the div tag I use a lot for semantics.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	The browser displays HTML from top to bottom, unless specified by CSS. A tip we recieved was that we should put scripts at the end of the page
	so that the HTML and CSS can load first before the scripts.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	
	Yes, sublime is a very powerful text editor that can be customized to a users preferences. I use the emmet package on my Sublime version and its a
	big time saver when it comes to typing and such. It really is a great tool and I will use the sublime-snippets as I need more and more shortcuts for
	things that I code.

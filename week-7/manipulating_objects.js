 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.
var adam = {
  name: "Adam"

}
terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
var carson = { name: "Carson" }
terah.children.carson = carson;
var carter = {name: "Carter" }
terah.children.carter = carter;
var colton =  {name: "Colton"}
terah.children.colton = colton;
adam.children = terah.children;

What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
  
  I had no problems making any of the tests pass. Objects in JS are like hashes in Ruby
  and it helps to visualize them in that way.  

How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?

  It eas not defficult. Essentially, it was just a matter of using the delete keyword
  and refering that to the property we are trying to delete. The syntax is easy to 
  understand and seems to make sense altogether.  

What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?

  I learned that you can have objects inside objects, kind of like how you can have hashes
  inside of hashes. Also I think objects are very similar to Ruby hashes except they are more
  powerful because they can hold functions as well. I guess they are a mixture of classes
  and hashes from Ruby, but not completely.

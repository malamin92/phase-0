Questions:
Introduction:
Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
	
	I learned some interesting facts about programming in general as well as JS. For example, the early
	computers were just running binary operations. I didn't know that Netscape was the first browser to 
	include JS. I didn't know ECMAScript and JavaScript meant the same thing. It's cool that JavaScript
	is also used in databases like MongoDB, that's something new to me.

Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?

	There are no cocepts that I feel uncomfortable with.

Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to 
numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.

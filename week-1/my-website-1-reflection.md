### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a 
###non-technical person.
You go to your github home page and hit the '+New Repository' ont hr right hand side of the page. You add a name of the repo and confirm the creation. You can create a empty repo or initialize it with a readme. Once you create the repo, you should see a link on the right hand side, this is the link to your repo. On your command line, go to a directory you want to clone the repo to. Once there, you type 'git clone (paste the link you copied here, no parenthasis)'. This will clone the repo to your local comptuer where you can work on the git files that were created when you cloned the repo.


### Describe what open source means.
Open source means you are free to use those technologies. You allow everyone to see how the software was made and also let them modify them however they please. 


### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think open source is great. When you want to make something that is truly going to change the world and you need help from other people, it's a great way to go. Anyone can contrbute to your project. If you want to keep software private and to yourself (like apple), this is not the way to go. It does feel like utopia but the choice is left up to the person who is making their project open source, so ultimately the createor can still be in charge if they so chose to not make their project open source.


### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses keep a programmer protected. They automatically copyright in the US. They also allow others to work on the project that is licensed with limitations set by the creator of the project. 


### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I kept forgetting to make branches when making the changes, that is something I think will become more second hand when I work with git more. I'm not used to the git workflow yet, but I think that will change.


### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No, all the DBC materials were sufficient.

# Format an Address

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below

def make_address(street, city, state, zip)
	return "You live at #{street}, in the beautiful city of #{city}, #{state}. Your zip is #{zip}."
end


# Create a method called make_address that accepts parameters for the street, city , state, and zip and returns a single address string.

# For example if we call the method as follows:

# make_address("633 Folsom St.", "San Francisco", "CA", "94107")
# The return value would be

# "You live at 633 Folsom St., in the beautiful city of San Francisco, CA. Your zip is 94107."

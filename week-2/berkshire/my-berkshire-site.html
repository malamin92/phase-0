<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

	I think HTML is pretty awesome. I have had previous experience with HTML and I always liked it for
	its simplicity. I like how using semantic HTML you can see the page in your head if you just imagine
	the tags and how they're laid out. Applying the concept of the HTML tree and seeing it come to life is
	very rewarding.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

	I really liked researching each tag and seeing how they function and play a role in the page. All the tags
	must co-exist in their own space (with some exceptions like the 'div' tag which doesn't do anything but create
	sections for you to reference the embedded HTML). Some tags are self-closing like the 'img' tag which can be a
	little confusing. I didn't have to do too much research because I was already familiar with a lot of the tags.
	Also, the <head> tag is really interesting in terms of semantics. These are things you cannot actually see in
	the page itself but rather play a big role in terms of identification of the page, (the <title> tag). It also
	is a convinient place for you to add links to other assets like javascript and CSS. The charset determines what 
	characters can be viewed on your page and is usually put in the <head> section as well.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	
	HTML is simply the contents that will be viewd on your page. The tags are individual elements that make up the
	'tree'. Looking at HTML this way, it makes sense for their to be no formatting in HTML. The HTML should simply be
	the markup of the page. How the mark-up looks in terms of style interaction is a whole seperate thing. This is good
	to keep in mind so it makes sense that it is also best practice. Using best practices allows you to keep the styling
	of your page seperate from what the content of your page holds. I kept that in my when doing the HTML and did not use
	any styling tags at all, saving it for the CSS section later on in the course.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	
	What's good about HTML is that it is very straight forward. It's a way to tell the browser what to put on the page and 
	that's all it is. It doesn't worry about styling or anything complicated. It's just a layout and is great because of its
	simplicty. 

	The bad thing about HTML in my opinion is that it's very manual. That's a caveat to its simplicty because you have to hand
	write all the HTML. There are no loops or iterations for repetitve elements or any automated content generation. It's also
	not interactive on its own withot javascript (for the most part).

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	
	When it comes to writing HTML, I always try to keep things seperate. It's a good idea to always use the tag that is relavent
	to content you are trying to add to the page. As long as you keep that in mind, it is much simpler to design the page to look
	the way you want it to. This also sections out the differnt parts of the page and keeps things from getting too chaotic when
	looking back on the code at any point. Also, I try to keep the HTML very semantic so that the relvance of each section is 
	obvious, for example, always use <h1> and <p> tags for headers and sub sections.
